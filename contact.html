        <h1>HelpWanted<br>User Study</h1>
        <p class="lead">When I was challenged to develop an application to address a need, I created HelpWanted; a mobile application, designed by a high school teacher, that introduces eager students to a welcoming workforce.</p>

          <h4>Why UX?</h4>
          <p>Bloc’s User Experience Design Bootcamp enabled me to combined my current knowledge of teaching pedagogy with outcome-focused design concepts passed on by my mentors at Bloc. I entered design bootcamp inspired to increase my knowledge of content development and design, a skill that I had familiarized myself with during my current career as a special education teacher. 
          My teaching career challenges me to manipulate content to meet the needs of individual learners. An assessment that measures comprehension of Chemistry curriculum, for example, will be given to me to accommodate based on the needs of students in a class. 
          I will condense, clarify and streamline the assessment in order to provide a platform where a student could demonstrate their comprehension in ways that are not solely selecting from a multiple choice list. 
          I see these skills mirrored in a career with User Experience and Design. I have experience working with content and addressing user intent. I am able to manipulate a product to clarify its purpose to users and streamline the outcome of an application. 
</p>

          

          <h4>The How of HelpWanted</h4>
          <p>
          HelpWanted is designed to meet the needs of High School students who would be entering the workforce during their holiday or summer breaks. Designed for mobile, HelpWanted reaches our target user on the platform they use most, their phone. Every step of the application process is sensitive to the restrictions our students face in trying to secure employment: 

          A map feature allows users to prioritize job openings within walking distance or accessible through public transit. 
          Submitting additional documentation to employers is completed using file organizational sites like Dropbox and Drive, sites that are commonly used in secondary schools. 
          User responses and added documentation can be saved and applied to other openings to efficiently apply for additional positions. 


          Our users can take the application process a step further if they choose, by entering HelpWanted’s Resume Writer. 
          Users are given the chance of adding a resume to their application through Google Drive or DropBox
          Resumes can be edited to perfection by following the Resume Writer prompts and suggestions.  
          Users also have the opportunity to create a resume from scratch using HelpWanted’s Resume Writer. 


          Keeping in mind the restrictions of our users and of a mobile application, the information required to write a resume is brief and concise. 
          HelpWanted is an application that was created to streamline and expedite the process of companies hiring eager employees. As an educator, I witnessed the potential my students had and needed outside agencies to see it too.</p>

        <h4>Applications that Address Need</h4>
          <p>When my Bloc curriculum tasked me with the challenge to create an application that would solve a problem, I thought back to the roadblocks I had encountered while teaching in high school classrooms. A revisited an obstacle I had experienced numerous times; my students were often not equipped to independently secure employment by their graduation date. 
          Every year, many of my students were graduating from high school without career prospects. Many lacked work experience and some had never experienced the job application process. I felt that my students were being set up to fail; tasked to locate, apply, and successfully interview for jobs independently, having never realistically completed the process before. 
          To conquer this hurdle, I created HelpWanted, an employment portal. HelpWanted is an application that will enable users, my students, to find local jobs that will not restrict applicants based on their current education. Users can locate a job by proximity and submit an application for the job efficiently. If a user is new to the workforce, they could use HelpWanted’s Resume Writer to develop a concise and professional resume that can be applied to any future job openings. </p>

          <h4>Overcoming Design Challenges</h4>
          <p>Users of HelpWanted would access the application as a way of efficiently securing employment. In designing this application I kept the outcome of my application in mind by recalling the ‘user stories’ of the students who were previously in my care.
          </p>

          <h4>Problems</h4>
          <p>
            My users may not have access to reliable transportation.  
            My users are new to the work force and may lack employment experience. 
            HelpWanted is a mobile application which directs its users to input large amounts of text. 
</p>

          <h4>Solutions</h4>
          <p>
              Highlight the proximity of job openings to the user’s current location, display jobs on a map to provide the user with visual representation. 
              Prioritize open positions from employers who offer part time and seasonal employment. Retail stores searching for additional staff during holiday seasons or local park districts needing summer workers, for example. 
              HelpWanted’s application and Resume Writer services are designed to prompt users to input only required information when necessary. 
              Input fields are intelligently designed with mobile in mind, users are prompted to provide specific concise facts during their application process, rather than construct paragraphs based on open ended questions.
